# ChangeLog file for selinux
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed May  6 2020 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- There was a problem with the MonetDB SELinux support on Fedora 32.
  That is fixed in this release.  In order to do a proper upgrade of
  the package if you have already installed MonetDB-selinux on Fedora
  32, you may need to uninstall (dnf remove) the old package and then
  install the new.
