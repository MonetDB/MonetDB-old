command leftfetchjoin_sorted ( left:bat[:oid], right:bat[:oid] ) :bat[:oid]
address RDFleftfetchjoin_sorted
comment "like algebra_leftfetchjoin(), but asserts that the resulting tail column is sorted -- ONLY USE IF YOU ARE SURE OF THIS!!! also requires sorted tail left input"

command rdf2str(i:bat[:oid],map:bat[:str]):bat[:str]
address TKNZRrdf2str
comment "converts id's into strings using the dictionary, but if (id >= RDF_MIN_LITERAL) look it up in a literal map bat";

command partialjoin(lmap:bat[:oid], rmap:bat[:oid], input:bat[:oid]):bat[:oid]
address RDFpartialjoin
comment "Join the input bat and the map bat (lmap, rmap). However, do not use nil for non-matching value but use the original value from input bat"
