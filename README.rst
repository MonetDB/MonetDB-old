The MonetDB Database System
===========================

The MonetDB database was originally developed by the `CWI`__ `database
research group`__ (see https://www.monetdb.org/).  Development has now
shifted to the spin-off company `MonetDB Solutions`__.

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open
source, where it is accessible at https://www.monetdb.org/Downloads/.
Even though development happens mostly in a company, the MonetDB
database system will remain open source.

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB source can be found at our
`Mercurial server`__. There is also a `github mirror`__ that is updated
once a day.
